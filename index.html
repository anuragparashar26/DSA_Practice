        <h3>Lab Programs</h3>
        <li> 1. Develop a Program in C for the following:<br>
          a. Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent 
          7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first 
          field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the 
          date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a 
          particular day (A dynamically allocated String).<br>
          b. Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data 
          from the keyboard and to print weeks activity details report on screen. <br>
          <mark><a href="https://github.com/anuragparashar26/DSA_College/blob/main/Programs/calendar.c" target="_blank">Link to Program</a></mark></li>
          <br>
        <li> 3. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven 
          Program in C for the following operations on STACK 
          of Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with 
          maximum size MAX)<br>
          a. Push an Element on to Stack<br>
          b. Pop an Element from Stack<br>
          c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check 
          Palindrome<br>
          d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations 
          on Stack<br>
          e. Display the status of Stack<br>
          f. Exit.<br>
          Support the program with appropriate functions for 
          each of the above operations. <mark><a href="https://github.com/anuragparashar26/DSA_College/blob/main/Programs/stack.c" target="_blank">Link to Program</a></mark></li>
          <br>
          <li>
            4. Develop a Program in C for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression. Program 
            should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized 
            expressions with the operators: +, -, *, /, % (Remainder), ^ (Power) and alphanumeric 
            operands. <mark><a href="https://github.com/anuragparashar26/DSA_College/blob/main/Programs/infix2postfix.c" target="_blank">Link to Program</a></mark>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            5. Develop a Program in C for the following Stack Applications <br>
            a. Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *, /, %, ^ <br>
            b. Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks

          </li>
          <br>
        <li> 6. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven 
          Program in C for the following operations on Circular 
          QUEUE of Characters (Array Implementation of 
          Queue with maximum size MAX)<br>
          a. Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE<br>
          b. Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE<br>
          c. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on 
          Circular QUEUE<br>
          d. Display the status of Circular QUEUE<br>
          e. Exit<br>
          Support the program with appropriate functions for 
          each of the above operations. <mark><a href="https://github.com/anuragparashar26/DSA_College/blob/main/Programs/circularqueue.c" target="_blank">Link to Program</a></mark></li>
