        <h3>Lab Programs</h3>
        <li> 1. Develop a Program in C for the following:<br>
          a. Declare a calendar as an array of 7 elements (A dynamically Created array) to represent 
          7 days of a week. Each Element of the array is a structure having three fields. The first 
          field is the name of the Day (A dynamically allocated String), The second field is the 
          date of the Day (A integer), the third field is the description of the activity for a 
          particular day (A dynamically allocated String).<br>
          b. Write functions create(), read() and display(); to create the calendar, to read the data 
          from the keyboard and to print weeks activity details report on screen.

          <br>
          <li>
            2. Develop a Program in C for the following operations on Strings. <br>
            a. Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP) <br>
            b. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in  STR with REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does not exist in STR <br>
            Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use built-in functions.

            should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized 
            expressions with the operators: +, -, *, /, % (Remainder), ^ (Power) and alphanumeric 
            operands. <mark><a href="https://github.com/anuragparashar26/DSA_College/blob/main/Programs/infix2postfix.c" target="_blank">Link to Program</a></mark>
